MyServiceTest
=============

This is a markdown file representing
the implementation of unit tests for a service.
In real world, this file contains some source
code for example in Java.

Note: For some features, there are no tests.

Imports

Imports are kind of special to Java.
Basically, you list all of the external classes
you use. We have checkstyle rules to keep the
imports sorted.
